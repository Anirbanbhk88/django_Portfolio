# django_Portfolio 
This is a portfolio project created in django. The project has 2 parts/django applications
1. **projects**: a list of some of my personal and professional projects that I did in my previous employments. Since I have done software engineering(mobile app development) prior to machine learnin so I have listed different projects
The projects app depicts the professional part of me
