# django_Portfolio 
This is a portfolio project created in django. The project has 2 parts/django applications
1. projects: a list of some of my personal and professional projects that I did in my previous employments. Since I have done software engineering(mobile app development) prior to machine learnin so I have listed different projects
The projects app depicts the professional part of me

2. The second app is a personal blog. Since I occassionally write blogs and even plan to write more in future. So this app depicts the creative side of my portfolio.

Both the projects have been written in Python with django framework.
